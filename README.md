# react-hooks

what is Hook?

A hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React feature
For example -- useState
useState ---> It is a hook that lets you add React state to function componets.

When would I use a Hook?

If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class .
Now you can use a hook inside the existing function component.

Rules for hooks-------------------------------------------------
1. Always write it inside the components or function
2. Component name must be PascalCase (first letter should be uppercase)
3. we can directly import or we can directly write it using react hookname.
4. Don't call Hooks inside loops,conditions, or nested functions.
