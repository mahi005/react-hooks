# react-hooks

what is Hook?

A hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React feature
For example -- useState
useState ---> It is a hook that lets you add React state to function componets.

When would I use a Hook?

If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class .
Now you can use a hook inside the existing function component.
